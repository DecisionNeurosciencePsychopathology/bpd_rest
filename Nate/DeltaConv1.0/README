Dependencies:

CMake
Armadillo
BLAS

All 3 must be installed (CMake required to install Armadillo) and on libpath

Notes:

-Node numbering must start at 1
-Assumes no edge unless explicitly defined (directed graph format)
-Sparse matrix files should have lines in the format 'src dest 1' (relative order of lines does not matter) - do not use the quotes

Build as follows:

make

OR

make demo (for demo on input files B5.txt and B5_mod.txt - barbell graph and modified barbell graph)

Run as follows:

./deltacon filelist window-size naive|fast group-fraction 

Parameters:

filelist: list of input data files in sparse format (if they are time-evolving, list the paths in that order, one per line)

window-size: number of files from filelist to consider as "1 graph" - 2 means first 2 files together comprise 1 graph - in general, a sliding window of size window-size is used to iterate over the filelist

naive|fast: naive uses the quadratic, but exact DeltaCon0 method (as referred to in the paper), fast uses approximate but linear on #edges DeltaCon method

group-fraction: decimal value, used to specify approx. how many of the nodes should be in each group if doing fast (include group fraction even if naive - only used if fast - normally use 0.1~ but can vary);

Interpreting Output:

Output is structured as follows...

Node Attribution results (in format 'node node-attr-score')

Edge Attribution results (in format 'srcnode destnode plus-or-minus-symbol edge-attr-score')

Similarity score (0 is completely dissimilar, 1 is completely similar)
Timings (in seconds)
